We shared about an approach to telling our story that involves learning, taking ownership, lamenting, repenting, healing, and restoration so we can move forward humbly and more like Jesus. We are currently reviewing proposals from people who might be able to partner with us through this process, and we believe this long and difficult work will be key to moving forward as a church."
